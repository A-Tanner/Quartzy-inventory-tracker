#Guidelines For Future Developers

The app project files are all stored in the EagleTracks folder.
In EagleTracks, you will find the App.js file responsible for holding the StyleSheet, Navigation Stack, and any functions that need to be ran once upon app startup (in currently, creating our local database tables).
The EagleTracks folder also stores our .js files for accessing our databases and Quartzy's API.
The Components folder stores different potentially reusable components for the app.
The assets folder stores default information used by Expo.
In the Pages folder you'll find all of the different pages accessed by the stack navigator.

All data related to the app is stored across the branches: main, Arthur-Branch, Barcode-scanner, and CSV-Branch, and in the forks CKappes-Git/Quartzy-inventory-tracker, and A-Tanner/Quartzy-inventory-tracker.  

For instructions on how to build the software for local use, see README.MD.
